🚀 Launching Noor UI from the GCC – An RTL-first React Component Library

I'm currently in the GCC on my first trip to the Middle East, and there's no better time to share this project I've been building.

---

💡 THE PROBLEM I KEPT SEEING:

Building interfaces for Arabic markets shouldn't be this hard. Most UI libraries treat RTL as an afterthought. Developers waste hours fixing layout bugs that shouldn't exist.

---

✨ WHAT I'VE BUILT:

Noor UI (نور - "Light") - 74+ React components designed RTL-first from day one.

• Built with logical CSS properties (not left/right hacks)
• Battle-tested in production: kitab.noorui.com
• Full Arabic & English support
• Works with Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, Farsi
• TypeScript + Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS
• GCC-specific components: Prayer Times, Hijri Calendar, Zakat Calculator

---

🎁 PROOF IT WORKS - Kitab Blog Starter:

A fully-featured multilingual blog with 4 languages (EN/AR/FR/UR), MDX content, and admin dashboard. Real production use, not just demos.

👉 Live: kitab.noorui.com
👉 Docs: noorui.com

---

⚠️ BEING DIRECT:

This is v0.4.4 - I've built this as a solo developer over the last months. It's working in production, the architecture is solid, but I need help to make it exceptional.

---

🤝 SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR:

Arabic Volunteers Needed:
• Native Arabic speakers to review UX patterns
• Developers in MENA who understand local needs
• RTL experts to find edge cases
• Anyone building for Arabic markets

This is an opportunity to shape THE RTL resource for React. Your input will help thousands of developers.

---

📍 WHY NOW:

Being here in the GCC, I'm seeing firsthand how critical proper Arabic support is. This isn't just about RTL - it's about respect for 400M+ Arabic speakers who deserve interfaces that feel native, not translated.

🚀 Launching Noor UI - the first RTL-first React component library

74+ components built specifically for Arabic/English applications

No more fighting with flex-direction.
No more !important hacks.

Open source. Battle-tested. Free forever.

🧵 Here's what I've built (and why I need your help):

[Attach bilingual OG image]
```

---

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
```
Most UI libraries were built for English.

RTL is patched on later. text-align: right doesn't cut it.

Result? Arabic interfaces feel like afterthoughts.

As a solo dev building for MENA markets, I got tired of fighting the same bugs.

So I rebuilt from scratch - RTL-first.
```

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
```
Noor UI is built RTL-first:

• Logical CSS properties (not left/right)
• Bidirectional components
• Arabic typography (Noto Naskh)
• Full keyboard navigation (both directions)
• Icons that flip correctly

Works with Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, Farsi.

v0.4.4 - actively maintained, growing with community.
```

---

**Tweet 4 (Features):**
```
What you get:

✅ 74 components (forms, data, navigation, overlays)
✅ 4 design themes
✅ GCC-specific: Prayer Times, Hijri Calendar, Zakat
✅ TypeScript + Tailwind + Radix UI
✅ Next.js 15 ready

All documented: https://noorui.com

v0.4.4 - Not perfect yet - that's why I need your help!
```

---

**Tweet 5 (Kitab Example):**
```
Proof it works?

Kitab - a production blog starter I built:

• 4 languages (EN/AR/FR/UR)
• MDX content
• Admin dashboard
• Comment system

Subject: Built an open-source RTL-first React library - looking for feedback

Hi everyone,

I've been working on Noor UI - an RTL-first component library for bilingual applications, and I'd love this community's feedback.

The challenge: Most UI libraries treat Arabic/RTL as an afterthought. I've rebuilt from scratch using logical CSS properties.

What I have so far:
• 74+ components (TypeScript + Tailwind + Radix)
• Production example running (Kitab blog starter)
• Docs site with examples
• v0.4.4 on npm

What I need:
• Native Arabic speakers to validate UX
• Developers who've built for MENA markets
• Feedback on what's missing

This is a solo project building in public. Not perfect yet, but the foundation is solid.

Check it out: https://noorui.com
GitHub: https://github.com/ositaka/noor-ui

Would appreciate any feedback or suggestions!

Title: [Open Source] Noor UI - RTL-first React component library (v0.4.4, looking for feedback)

I've spent the last several months building Noor UI - an open-source component library designed specifically for bilingual applications with proper RTL support.

**The Problem:**
If you've ever built for Arabic markets, you know the pain: flex-direction issues, text-align hacks, icons not flipping correctly, keyboard navigation breaking in RTL mode.

**What I've Built:**
- 74 components using logical CSS properties
- Battle-tested in a production blog (Kitab: https://kitab.noorui.com)
- TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- Full accessibility (WCAG AA)
- Works with Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, Farsi

**Being Honest:**
This is v0.4.4 - a solo developer project. The architecture is solid and I'm using it in production, but I need community help to make it bulletproof. Looking for:
- Native Arabic speakers to validate UX
- RTL experts to find edge cases
- Feedback on what's missing

**Links:**
- Docs: https://noorui.com
- GitHub: https://github.com/ositaka/noor-ui
- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/noorui-rtl

Would love your honest feedback! What would make this useful for you?

Title: Built an RTL-first React component library for Arabic/bilingual apps [Open Source, looking for feedback]

After fighting RTL layout bugs for too long, I built Noor UI - a component library designed RTL-first from the ground up.

**What makes it different:**
Instead of patching RTL support onto LTR components, everything is built with logical CSS properties (inline-start/end instead of left/right). This means components work perfectly in both directions without configuration.

**What's included:**
- 74+ components (forms, data tables, navigation, overlays)
- Full Arabic typography support
- GCC-specific components (Prayer Times, Hijri Calendar, Zakat Calculator)
- Built with TypeScript + Tailwind + Radix UI
- Production example: https://kitab.noorui.com (multilingual blog with 4 languages)

**Honest status:**
It's v0.4.4 - I'm using it in production but this is a solo project. I need community help to stress-test and improve it.

**Why I'm sharing:**
Looking for feedback from developers who build for international markets, especially MENA region. What's missing? What would make this useful for you?

**Links:**
- Docs: https://noorui.com
- GitHub: https://github.com/ositaka/noor-ui
- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/noorui-rtl

Open to all feedback and contributions!

---

## 💬 RESPONSE TEMPLATES

**When someone finds a bug:**
```
"Great catch! That's exactly the kind of feedback I need.
Mind opening an issue on GitHub? I'll prioritize this."
```

**When someone asks "why not use X library?"**
```
"[Library X] is great for LTR, but RTL is patched on later.
Noor UI is built RTL-first - different architecture.
That said, I'm taking inspiration from the best!"
```

**When someone offers to help:**
```
"That would be amazing! Join the Discord and let's chat: [link]
Or feel free to pick up any issue marked 'good first issue' on GitHub."
```

**When someone is critical but fair:**
```
"Thanks for the honest feedback. You're right about [issue].
That's on my roadmap for v0.5. What would you prioritize?"
```

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY RESPONSES

**If someone says "this is just a copy of shadcn":**
```
"shadcn is incredible and inspired parts of this! But shadcn is LTR-first.
Noor UI is RTL-first - different architecture using logical CSS properties.
Think of it as solving a different problem."
```

**If someone says "RTL is easy, just use direction: rtl":**
```
"That works for basic text, but breaks with flex layouts, absolute positioning,
transforms, animations, etc. Logical CSS properties + proper architecture
is the only way to make it work reliably."
```

**If someone says "not production ready":**
```
"You're right that it's v0.4.4 and evolving. But I'm using it in production
(Kitab), and the core patterns are solid. What specific concerns do you have?
I'd love to address them."
```
