# AI Assistant Rules & Guidelines

This file contains important rules for AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) and automated tools working with this codebase.

## 🚫 **NEVER DELETE WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION**

### `/docs/case-studies/` folder
- Contains planning documents that are **source material for blog posts**
- Even if files seem outdated, they have **historical and educational value**
- Files here are **content assets**, not throwaway documentation
- If cleanup is needed, **ask the maintainer first**

### `/docs/dev-archives/` folder
- Contains the **complete development history** of Noor UI
- Every planning doc, status update, and task note from the journey
- This is the "making of" story - **never delete without permission**
- Think of it as a time capsule, not trash
- Useful for understanding "why we built it this way"

### Other protected documentation:
- `ROADMAP.md` - Project planning and history
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - User-facing documentation
- Any file in `/docs/case-studies/`
- Any file marked with `<!-- DO NOT DELETE -->` comment

---

## ⚠️ **Protected Archives**

### `/docs/dev-archives/` folder (formerly `/docs/archive/`)
- Contains the **complete development journey** of Noor UI
- All planning docs, status files, and task notes are preserved
- **DO NOT suggest deletion** - this is historical record
- Think: "development museum", not "trash bin"

**Rule:** Never delete anything from `/docs/dev-archives/` - it's the project's history.

---

## 📝 **When Organizing Documentation**

### Always ask before:
- Deleting any `.md` file
- Moving files out of `/docs/case-studies/`
- Removing files from the root directory
- Archiving anything that looks like "planning" or "process"

### Safe to organize:
- Moving completed tasks to `/docs/archive/`
- Creating new folders in `/docs/`
- Updating outdated information (with maintainer approval)
- Adding new documentation

---

## 🎯 **Special File Types**

### Case Studies & Design Docs
**Pattern:** `*-design-process.md`, `*-planning.md`, `*-case-study.md`
- These are **content creation material**
- Treat as permanent, even if outdated
- Move to `/docs/case-studies/` if they're valuable

### Development Planning
**Pattern:** `PLAN.md`, `STRATEGY.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- May have future blog/educational value
- Ask before deleting
- Consider moving to case studies instead

### Temporary/Status Files
**Pattern:** `*-STATUS.md`, `*-COMPLETE.md`, `TODO-*.md`
- Usually safe to archive after task completion
- But still ask first!

## 🤖 **For AI Assistants Specifically**

### 🚨 **CRITICAL: Git Commit Rules**

**NEVER create git commits without explicit user permission.**

**ALWAYS:**
1. Stage the changes with `git add`
2. Show the user what changed with `git status` or `git diff`
3. **ASK permission**: "Should I commit these changes?"
4. **WAIT** for user confirmation
5. Only then run `git commit`

**Example - Good behavior:**
```
AI: "I've made these changes:
- Modified: toast.tsx (RTL positioning)
- Modified: badge/page.tsx (bilingual labels)
- Modified: components/page.tsx (GCC-first ordering)

Should I commit these changes?"
User: "yes"
AI: *runs git commit*
```

**Example - Bad behavior:**
```
AI: *automatically runs git commit without asking*
```

**Why this matters:**
- User may want to review changes first
- User may want to modify the commit message
- User may want to split changes into multiple commits
- User may want to test before committing

**Exception:** ONLY if user explicitly says "commit this" or "make a commit" in their message.

### File Organization Rules

When you encounter a file that seems like it could be deleted:

1. **Check this file first** - Is it protected?
2. **Check the file location** - Is it in `/docs/case-studies/`?
3. **Check the file name** - Does it match a protected pattern?
4. **When in doubt** - Ask the user: "I found [file]. Should I archive, move to case studies, or keep as-is?"

### Good AI behavior:
✅ "I found `AI_LLM_SHELL_PLAN.md` - this looks like a design process doc. Should I move it to `/docs/case-studies/` for future blog content?"

❌ "Found old planning file `AI_LLM_SHELL_PLAN.md`, deleting..."

---

## 📚 **Why These Rules Exist**

1. **Content is an asset** - Planning docs become blog posts, case studies, and educational material
2. **History matters** - Future maintainers need to understand past decisions
3. **Transparency** - Open documentation builds trust with the community
4. **Learning resource** - Others can learn from our process, not just our code

---

**TL;DR:** When in doubt, ask before deleting. Documentation is as valuable as code.
