components from the .md files:
- card number
- phone number
- website url

Perhaps we could create a list or a set of accessibile input fields ready to use and list all them on a single demo/preview


Components to create:
- carousel
- sidebar
- timeline
- resizable panels
- multi-select / combobox
– loading / spinner ??? is it really needed? we have already the skeleton component.
- currency input/formatter, with proper decimal handling
- Navigation
    - top navigation bar (responsive)
    - bottom navigation bar (mobile)
    - menu / megamenu
- offline status / no internet connection available


Components to enhance:
- data table has no sorting on the /components route examples
- range slider just shows one handler instead of 2
- hijri-date // Does it have islamic holiday highlighted ??



To review RTL issues:
- breadcrumbs (icon is on the wrong direction I guess)
- pagination (icon is on the wrong direction I guess)
- select (not changing orientation)
- switch (the indicator is sliding on the wrong direction)



Create a 404 page




To consider, but just asking if it's actually needed or if it's just to add more noise to the project:
- Layout Primitives
    - stack (horizontal/vertical)
    - grid system
    - container

- BiDi Text Input


- Examples:
    - Settings page: tabbed interface, all form controls, switch toggles, theme selection, language/direction toggle, sabe/reset actions
