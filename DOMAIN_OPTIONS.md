- Represents bilingual/RTL nature of the project

---

## 🔝 Top 3 Recommendations

### **Option 1: Noor UI** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Domain:** `noorui.com` ✅ AVAILABLE
**NPM:** `@noorui/components` or `noorui`
**Meaning:** نور = "Light" in Arabic

#### Pros:
- ✅ Beautiful Arabic word with poetic meaning
- ✅ Short and memorable
- ✅ .com domain (auto-links everywhere)
- ✅ Easy to pronounce in both languages
- ✅ Great storytelling: "Bringing light to bilingual design"
- ✅ Cultural authenticity

#### Cons:
- ⚠️ Requires explanation of meaning at first
- ⚠️ Several "Noor" projects exist (but in different domains)
- ⚠️ Could be misheard as "Nori" or "Noory"

#### Conference Intro:
> "Noor UI - noor means 'light' in Arabic, bringing light to bilingual interface design"

#### Brand Story:
> "Just like light illuminates equally in all directions, Noor UI works seamlessly in both LTR and RTL layouts, bringing clarity to multilingual design."

#### Package Usage:
```bash
npm install @noorui/components
```

```tsx
import { Button, Card } from '@noorui/components'
```

**Rating: 9/10** - Best balance of cultural authenticity, memorability, and practicality

---

### **Option 2: Bidirect UI**

**Domain:** `bidirectui.com` ✅ AVAILABLE
**NPM:** `@bidirect/components` or `bidirectui`
**Meaning:** Bidirectional (two directions)

#### Pros:
- ✅ Crystal clear what it does
- ✅ No pronunciation ambiguity
- ✅ .com domain
- ✅ Professional and technical
- ✅ Easy to remember after hearing once

#### Cons:
- ❌ No cultural connection to Arabic/MENA
- ❌ More generic/corporate sounding
- ❌ Longer domain name
- ❌ Less emotionally resonant

#### Conference Intro:
> "Bidirect UI - true bidirectional components for modern web apps"

#### Brand Story:
> "Building interfaces that work perfectly in any direction, without compromise."

**Rating: 7/10** - Most practical but lacks soul

---

### **Option 3: Dual UI**

**Domain:** `dualui.com` ✅ AVAILABLE
**NPM:** `@dualui/components` or `dualui`
**Meaning:** Two/Dual (languages, directions)

#### Pros:
- ✅ Super simple
- ✅ Short domain
- ✅ Easy pronunciation

#### Cons:
- ❌ Too generic ("dual" is overused in tech)
- ❌ Could mean "two themes" or "two modes" - not specific
- ❌ Less memorable
- ❌ No cultural connection

**Rating: 5/10** - Too generic, not recommended

---

## 💭 Honorable Mentions (Rejected)

### Mashreq UI
- **Domain:** `mashreq.design` or `mashrequi.dev`
- **Why rejected:** `.design` costs $40+/year, `.dev` doesn't auto-link on LinkedIn/email
- **Alternative if reconsidered:** `getmashreq.com` or `usemashreq.com` might be available

### Jisr UI (جسر - Bridge)
- **Domain:** Would need to check `jisrui.com` or `jisr.design`
- **Meaning:** "Bridge" in Arabic - beautiful metaphor
- **Why not recommended:** Less immediately recognizable than Noor
