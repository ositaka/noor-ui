# 🗺️ Project Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision

Build the **go-to design system for bilingual (LTR/RTL) web applications**, starting with English and Arabic, with a focus on the MENA market and global multilingual products.

### Core Principles
- ✅ **RTL-first, not RTL-as-afterthought**
- ✅ **Real examples over theoretical components**
- ✅ **Quality over quantity** (1 great demo > 5 mediocre ones)
- ✅ **Open source and community-driven**
- ✅ **Production-ready, not just showcase**

---

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions:
- ✅ Use Supabase for all demos (consistent backend)
- ✅ Multilingual via JSONB fields (see MULTILINGUAL_STRATEGY.md)
- ✅ RBAC via Supabase Row Level Security (not custom solution)
- ✅ Build examples BEFORE packaging (validate patterns first)

### Scope Decisions:
- ✅ Start with 2 languages (EN + AR), expand later
- ✅ Focus on web first, mobile later
- ✅ React only initially, other frameworks in Phase 4+
- ✅ Tailwind CSS as foundation (not custom CSS)

### Community Decisions:
- ✅ Fully open source (MIT license)
- ✅ Accept contributions after Phase 2
- ✅ Documentation in English (Arabic guides as separate resource)
